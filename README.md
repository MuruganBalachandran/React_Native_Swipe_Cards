# Tarot Card Swiping App

Welcome to the Tarot Card Swiping App! This app displays a series of Tarot cards that users can swipe left or right, with animated effects.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project and run it on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **React Native Environment**: Complete the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for either Android or iOS.
- **Android Studio** (for Android) or **Xcode** (for iOS) should be installed and properly configured.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tarot-card-swiping-app.git
cd tarot-card-swiping-app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Start the Metro server by running:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

Keep this terminal open and running.

### Step 4: Run the Application

In a new terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the app on your emulator or connected device.

#### For Android:

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS:

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, your app should be running on the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.
